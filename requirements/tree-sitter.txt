#
# Tree Sitter - parser generator and analysis tooling.
#
# Notes:
#   - Python has a builtin Abstract Syntax Tree. 
#   - Each language has its own dependency. e.g. tree-sitter-c
#   - tree-sitter used to support LaTeX (in rust), but repo no longer exists.
#   - LaTeX will need to be created to mitigate nodejs security risks.
