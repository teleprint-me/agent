# tree-sitter - parser generator and analysis tooling.
#
# Notes:
#   - Python has a builtin Abstract Syntax Tree. 
#   - Each language has its own dependency. e.g. tree-sitter-c
#   - see: https://pypi.org/project/tree-sitter-language-pack/
#   - note: I do not plan on supporting every language (there are hundreds).
#           It's easier to target stuff I'm familiar with.
#   - note: I commented out the language packs that pip refuses to install.
#           Some of them are JavaScript based. Meson is C based.
#           Not all language packs show up in Pythons Package Index (PyPI).

# Required for web tools

# Never feed language models input from the web without scanning the contents for malicious inputs.
# Web‑dependent packages are flagged as vulnerable and excluded by default as a result.
#
# NOTEs: 
#   - The packages themselves are safe.
#   - Plugging them into a LM pipeline is unsafe.
